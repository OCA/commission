Sales commissions
=================

This module allows to define sales agents with their commissions and assign
them in customers and sales orders.

You can then make the settlements of these commissions, and generate the
corresponding supplier invoices to pay their commissions fees.

You can define which base amount is going to be taken into account: net amount
(based on margin) or gross amount (line subtotal amount)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
* If you add order lines with commissions, and after that, change partner,
  fiscal position, delivery method, or custom fields that changes something on
  the order lines, yet non-saved commission lines will be lost. This is due to
  a big bug partially documented in https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/17618.
* Make it totally multi-company aware.
* Allow to calculate and pay in other currency different from company one.
* Allow to group by agent when generating invoices.


Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/commission/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smash it by providing detailed and welcomed feedback.
