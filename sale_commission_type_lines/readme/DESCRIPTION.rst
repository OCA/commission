This module adds a new "type" in Commission Type, named "Rules", allowing to set conditions on commission based on the product according to the same logic of sale pricelist items.


System will apply different commissions based on variant/product/category or global, applied hierarchically.


These commission type items can be accessed and created by a specific menu, to facilitate their management in environments with lots of records.


The form for commission type item can be extended by future modules with further conditions to decide when to apply a specific item.
