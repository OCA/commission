This module extends sale_commission_product_criteria to allow user to restrict the commission granted to agent on a Sale Order Line according to the discount applied on the same line.

This is useful to implement a common commission structure for agents which provides a higher commission to agents granting a lower discount to customer, decreasing the commission proportionally as discount increases.
