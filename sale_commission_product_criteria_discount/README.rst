This module extends sale_commission_product_criteria to allow user to restrict the commission granted to agent on a Sale Order Line according to the discount applied on the same line.

This is useful to implement a common commission structure for agents which provides a higher commission to agents granting a lower discount to customer, decreasing the commission proportionally as discount increases.

Usage
=====

Make sure "Discounts" are enabled in General Settings > Sale

Go to Commissions > Configuration > Commission Type

In a record of type "Product criteria", create or select a line > set field "Based on" = "Discount"

Two new fields will be displayed to set the range of discount applied on Sale Order Line for which this Commission Type Item will be applicable.

Note that if in a Commission Type are present two Items applied to the same object (eg: the same product or same category), the one "Based on: Discount" is applied.
