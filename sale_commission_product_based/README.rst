This module allows to have commissions based on a product or a product category.

In the commission, it will be possible to configure a set of rules that refer to a product or a product category, and a fallback percentage.

Configuration
=============

In order to create a commission based on products, set "Commission type" to "Based on Product with Fallback Percentage".

Configure then the "Product rules" and the "Fallback Percentage" as desired.

Each rule is evaluated based on its sequence.

A rule is matched when the product involved is the product of the rule, or has the rule's category.

The commission percentage is the "Percentage" of the matching rule, if any, or the "Fallback Percentage".

Usage
=====

1. Create a commission having "Commission type" set to "Based on Product with Fallback Percentage", see `Configuration` for further details.
2. Create a sale order using that commission, see the module "Sales commissions" for the instructions on how to do that
