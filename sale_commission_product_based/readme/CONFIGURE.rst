In order to create a commission based on products, set "Commission type" to "Based on Product with Fallback Percentage".

Configure then the "Product rules" and the "Fallback Percentage" as desired.

Each rule is evaluated based on its sequence.

A rule is matched when the product involved is the product of the rule, or has the rule's category.

The commission percentage is the "Percentage" of the matching rule, if any, or the "Fallback Percentage".
