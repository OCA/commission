For setting default agents in partners:

1.  Go to *Invoicing \> Customers \> Customers* or *Contacts \>
    Contacts*.
2.  Edit or create a new record.
3.  On "Sales & Purchases" page, you will see a field called "Agents"
    where they can be added. You can put the number of agents you want,
    but you can't select specific commission for each partner in this
    base module.

For settling the commissions to agents:

1.  Go to *Commissions \> Settlements \> Settle Commissions*.
2.  On the window that appears, you should select the date up to which
    you want to create commissions. It should be at least one day after
    the last period date. For example, if you settlements are monthly,
    you have to put at least the first day of the following month.
3.  You can settle only certain agents if you select them on the
    "Agents" section. Leave it empty for settling all.
4.  Click on "Make settlements" button.
5.  If there are new settlements, they will be shown after this.
